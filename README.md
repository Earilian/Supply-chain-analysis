This is diagnostic and descriptive analysis using a Kaggle supply chain dataset aims to find out any possible problems with suppliers or any shortage with an inventory.
We are looking at:
* how many suppliers
* how many number of types of products are supplied by each supplier
* how many products have failed  in inspection, and who is the supplier
* how many products are below their stock levels
* Is a one-time order enough for those products to reach their stock level
To run this fiel properly you will need to download the original Kaggle dataset: supply_chain_data.csv
